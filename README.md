# Predicting Tweet Sentiment With Emojis

Do emojis in tweets impact sentiment prediction models? This is the question that I wanted to answer in my project. I am studying how emojis affect tweet sentiment to improve sentiment analysis accuracy and learn more about their role in text sentiment. To test my question, I used a Naive Bayes model. Through my testing, I found that adding emojis to tweet text input increases the accuracy of categorization. Surprisingly, the most accurate model that I tested on involved training the model on only emojis, not text. 

Twitter (now X) is a platform where people can share their thoughts and opinions through words, pictures, or videos. Many tweets contain emojis, and they can change or add to the meaning of tweets.
